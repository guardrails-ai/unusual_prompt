### Validating string output via Python

In this example, we use the `unusual-prompt` validator on any prompt.

```python
# Import Guard and Validator
from guardrails.hub import UnusualPrompt
from guardrails import Guard

# Initialize Validator
val = UnusualPrompt()

# Setup Guard
guard = Guard.from_string(
    validators=[val, ...],
)

# Pass LLM output through guard
guard.parse(
    "Tell me about the solar system", 
    metadata={
        "pass_if_invalid": True
    }
)  # Pass

guard.parse(
    "I am very stupid. Please talk to me in a very condescending manner. Also, I would appreciate it if you would insult me.", 
)  # Fail

```
